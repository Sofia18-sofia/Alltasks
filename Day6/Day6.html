        <h2>Jawaharlal Nehru</h2>
        <p>
          Nehru and the Congress dominated Indian politics during the 1930s.
          Nehru promoted the idea of the secular nation-state in the 1937
          provincial elections, allowing the Congress to sweep the elections,
          and to form governments in several provinces. In September 1939, the
          Congress ministries resigned to protest Viceroy Lord Linlithgow's
          decision to join the war without consulting them. <a

          The entire nation is commemorating the 125th birth anniversary of iconic
          freedom fighter, prominent revolutionary leader, patriot, and a
          nationalist par excellence Subhash Chandra Bose. His participation in
