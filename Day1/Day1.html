<h1>Agile methodology</h1>
<p>Agile methodology is a flexible and collaborative approach to managing projects, especially in software development. It emphasizes iterative progress, adaptability, and constant feedback to deliver value to customers more effectively. Agile was introduced as a response to the limitations of traditional project management methodologies, which were often rigid and slow.</p>
<h1> Waterfall Model</h1>
<p>The Waterfall model is a traditional, linear approach to project management and software development. It involves a sequence of distinct phases, where each phase must be completed before the next one begins. This method is often compared to a cascading waterfall, as progress flows steadily downward through predefined stages.</p>
<h4>Phases of the Waterfall Model</h4>
<pre>1.Requirements Gathering and Analysis
2.System Design
3.Implementation (Coding)
4.Testing
5.Deployment
6.Maintenance
